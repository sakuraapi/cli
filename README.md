# Installing

SakuraAPI CLI helps you scaffold new projects.

`npm install -g @sakuraapi/cli`

`sapi --help`

# Scaffolding a SakuraAPI project

`sapi init [dir]` where dir is the path to the directory in which you want to initialize the project.

You can also run `sapi init` within a directory and it will initialize the project there.

You can also run `sapi init` over an existing project and it will give you the option to diff changes file by file.

`sapi init` supports setting up the server without authentication, as a JWT issuer and as a JWT audience server.

# Generating Models, Routables and Services
`@Model`, `@Routable` and `@Injectable` files can be scaffolded individually to save you the hassle of setting them up.

The example below assume you are in the root of your project's directory.

Currently, generated output still needs to be manually injected when you instantiate `SakuraApi`. Don't forget or it won't work.

## Models
`sapi g model src/models/SomeModel`

This will create:

* `src/models/some-model.ts`
* `src/models/some-model.spec.ts`

## Routables
`sapi g routable src/api/SomeApi`

This will create:

* `src/api/some-api.ts`
* `src/api/some-api.spec.ts`

## Services (Injectables)

`sapi g service src/services/SomeService`

This will create:

* `src/services/some-service.ts`
* `src/services/some-service.spec.ts`


# Updating outdated dependencies
Managing the never ending process of updating your `package.json` dependencies can be tedious. `sapi outdated` will take you through your list of outdated dependencies, giving you the option for each dependency to either skip it, update it to the wanted version, or updated it to the latest version. After each update, `sapi` runs your unit-tests to make sure that particular update did not break your build. It also properly saves the new version in either `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in your `package.json` file. It's still a tedious process... but hopefully a little less so.

To get help with other options for outdated, use `sapi outdated --help`. 

# Some Caution

`sapi` cli is pretty early in its development. Make sure you have a backup of your files before you use it to update an existing project.

# Bugs and requests:

Please report bugs and reports here: https://github.com/sakuraapi/cli/issues

You can get debug output. For example: `DEBUG=sapi:* sapi --help`. Replace `--help` with whatever `sapi` command you want. This might help you report more accurate bugs... it might not.
